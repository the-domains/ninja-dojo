"The absolute BEST dojo in Colorado for Ninjutsu and Jujutsu" ---Chris Cord Fantastic martial arts are taught there. Not for everybody, if you can't behave in kids class they won't train you. Good for them having standards and sticking with them. Same thing in adult classes if you're a thug or a jerk they ask you not to train, which is great for those of us that want to train with good fun people. Some people might think they are elitists, but since they are the best school that I have trained at they can afford to be. You can't find a better school in my opinion. ---Jen Fairbanks Both of our kids, a girl & boy, have been with Sensei Benson for nearly 10 years. They've moved from the kid's classes to the adult classes and have enjoyed every minute. We "shopped around" at first, but no one came close to Sensei Benson's approach and expectation for developing the "whole person." "Kaizen" -- or "continuous improvement" is more than a business name here. If you desire the self-discipline of body and mind that authentic martial arts is about, then you can learn it here. My kids developed excellent skills to the point that I worry much less about my daughter walking across her college campus. But my real thanks to Sensei is for their well-developed sense of constant awareness of their surroundings, personal confidence and the impact of their actions on those around them. I give Kaizen Martial Arts an A+++ ---Wendy Adams If you're looking for real ninjutsu and jujutsu, then this is the place you need to be ---JD Goodwin Best dojo ever...sometimes funny, always skilled instruction in a discipline that is still an art and hasn't been watered down into a "sport". ---Daniel Hocker This Martial Arts Studio is the REAL deal! Forget Karate, Kung Fu or TaeKownDo, I'll take a real Ninja master any day of the week. GREAT instruction, FAIR prices, FUN environment. ---Christopher Lee
